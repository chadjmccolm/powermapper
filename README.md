# Info

This is a basic html, javascript, and css site that calculates a "Power Map". A term that I've coined to mean the chart of available acceleration at all speeds. This is designed to help compare vehicles more holisitically than just a simple horsepower, torque, or weight value. 

# Installation

There are no dependencies. This site should be able to run just after downloading. The current version of this site is hosted at chadmccolm.ca/powermapper/
